# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

When submitting patches, please consider:

*   Communicating and filling out the body text with proper explanations, not in comments (unless for comment patches, of course). I've seen patches which broke a module, so explanation is a must. If you have no time to write it in the body text, please hold off till later!
*   Providing optional links to the change records or documentation, if any.
*   Providing links to documentation is a must for coding standards issues. This also lets us, you, and me learn from the actual docs, not told by tools! We can just run `drupalcs ...`, but help is welcome, too, in case a miss.
*   Checking out the latest `dev` branch in case the issue is already resolved.
*   Providing reproduction steps for bug reports is a must. No reproduction, no bugs.

Speak human to human, and help us respect you and your time. Dumping patches with empty body text or any disrespectful negative posts will be disregarded until the above is met.

## Submitting Issues

When submitting bug reports, please:

*   Be kind with proper reproduction and enough details.
*   Mention the library version, related module version (if any), active theme, or anything which may help us identify the issue better.
*   Ensure the library is loaded, not a 404 error, and verify it can be viewed in the browser.
*   Switch to a stock (Responsive) theme like Bartik just in case it is your custom theme causing issues.
*   Switch to default formatters, image to Image, text to Default, etc.
*   Use matching or similar branches or tags for related modules.
*   Check out project issues for duplicates; your problem may be already addressed.
*   Consult descriptions on each form item.
*   File it as a support request if unsure. We'll mark a bug as a bug even if you file it under support requests.
