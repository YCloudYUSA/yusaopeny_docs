Okay,
people are joining. I'm accepting.
Let's wait maybe for
a minute and then we can get started.
Anyway, this call is going to be
recorded and then publish it to
community. Whoever would be able to
join, there's a chance to review
letting in the participants was always a
fun like video game for me as they pop
up, you know, got to accept, got to let
them in.
I click that button, accept all
automatically. So,
yeah. Well, it's more fun if you go for
them individually, though. That is true
video game.
Accept this one, deny this one. Right.
I'm kidding. That's just satisfying in
its own way.
Okay.
Hello.
Yeah. Hi there.
Good to see
people. People are joining.
I see.
So maybe we can get started.
Okay. Yeah,
cool.
I think word to you, Tom. And then feel
free to let me know.
All right. Yeah. No, thank you. Um,
yeah, just greetings everyone. It's it's
wonderful to see people on on the call.
Um yeah, I just want to say a quick word
that um you know YUSA has retained um
the talents of IT care to maintain the
code distribution through um well going
forward but through 2025. We have
promised that we will keep the code
distribution patched and updated for um
security updates and functionality
updates from the community. Um so that
progresses as you'll uh hear from the IT
care team through uh Drupal 10.4 and
then uh by end of year to Drupal 11 and
they're going to talk about that in more
in more detail. So while there is a
pause on new functionality being added
in 2025 um our commitment to keeping the
code distribution um secure and updated
and stable is what we're uh discussing
here. So, um, so anyway, with that, uh,
I'll return the floor over to Janna and
Andre.
Yeah, thank you so much, Tom. Welcome
everyone. Thank you for joining us
today. Thank you for joining this
community call. That's the first one in
2025.
Yeah. And I'm Janna from IT Care. uh
together with Y USA, we're excited to
share some progress ongoing work and
future opportunities around the YMCA
website services distribution.
And I'd like to say that our goal today
is to share first of all uh what's been
done. That's going to be a little report
uh performance improvements, upgrades,
uh collaborate on what's going to be
next like Drupal 11, Drupal CMS, etc.
And connect with the community. We'd
like to hear your questions, your
suggestions, uh and any other feedback
you may have. So, let's get started. Let
me share my screen. We have presentation
for this call. So that's going to be
this one. Let me share this.
Okay.
Yep. Can you see my screen?
Yes.
Okay.
Looks good. So before we dive in, I'd
like to share our agenda for today. So
number one, it's a Drupal 10.5 core
upgrade. I changed that one from Drupal
104 to Drupal 10 5 just this week. So
that's completed milestone that's
upgrade which come just this week. And
second one is Drupal 11 which is in
progress. So Andre will speak about this
and uh improvements to schedules that's
about speed flexibility
and preparing for the future. Um here
we'd like to discuss whatever would you
uh suggest maybe you'll have some
questions and also we'll share latest
updates what's going to be next. Yeah.
So that's agenda. Let me check if we
have intro.
So uh at this point I'd like to uh say
that each section from this agenda will
be lead by a team member from our side
and we also will share the way YMCA
members uh can get involved. So now I
think I'd like to pass my phone to
Ditro. So he will speak about Drupal
10.5
core upgrade.
Yeah, thank you Jana. Uh so uh the
Drupal uh 10.5 core upgrade is uh the
key update before Drupal 11 and uh it
includes uh several uh improvements. So
the key improvements are uh the core
functionality that uh has been improved
uh has been released to the in the new
version. The uh CK editor also includes
some of new features uh and uh it's
updated to the latest version. Uh the
membership calculator logic uh is uh the
um um logic that uh will exclude the
unpublished locations. Uh this is uh the
fix provided to membership uh builder
application.
Uh the media library improvements. Uh
this is the core uh updates. The media
entity document
module has uh functionality is now
involved in u Drupal core and there are
some fixes that are enable media library
to work faster and uh enables content
workflow abilities for content editors.
the uh content manager man permissions.
Uh uh the users now will now require the
administer content permission to perform
set certain bulk uh content operations.
Uh this will enhance the security
and uh the uh schedules program event
framework uh changes. uh this uh allows
uh the classes with special symbols to
be used uh in the application and um
that are the key improvements in the uh
10.5.
Um also with uh 10.54 core uh the some
of the security vulnerability
uh vulnerabilities were patched. The
unauthorized code injection that
prevents attackers from adding malicious
content scripts or popups uh to your web
pages. the um improper access control
that reinforces user permission checks
uh to ensure that only authorized staff
can access administrative functions
uh or sensitive data
and malicious code execution uh that
closes a potential loophole in how the
system processes the certain types of
data.
um and pre to prevent the the
sophisticated attack.
So yeah, these are the security
vulnerabilities.
As for the new features, uh these are
the uh
the features that uh were requested by
our uh partners in uh other
organizations
that have been implemented and added to
the functionality. So the expanding menu
on mouse hover uh this uh will go with
this version and uh this is an option
for the menu and uh display only the
hours option for the branch pages. Uh
it's for the uh branch hours um overlay
uh that allows to display all holidays
instead of the upcoming ones
and uh the certain bug fixes uh were
provided in this version. Uh
for the multiple alerts uh the error was
mis uh misaligned
and uh for some of the website the uh
mobile burger menu uh for sub pages uh
was fixed as well.
Uh so these are the uh key updates uh in
the Drupal 10.5 version and Janna could
you please next slide.
Sure.
Oh sorry
here we go.
Yeah. And why this update is important?
As you see, it keeps us aligned with the
latest security and performance
standards standards. So you can make
sure that uh when your site is updated
to the latest version, it complies uh uh
all the security standards now uh and uh
performance uh of the uh latest code uh
provided by the Drupal community and uh
open uh the YMCA community as well u
from the all the developers.
Um this also prepares ecosystem for the
future AI integrations uh within uh that
are allowed in the uh future Drupal uh
core. So for the AI uh it's just the
preparation research and uh um in this
case uh uh the system is getting ready
for this one. Uh and uh the current
challenge is uh to adjust uh some AI
tools that are remain partially blocked
uh due to the ecosystem constraints.
These are uh involves
um clarifying the business needs and
requirements and uh building the
architecture.
So uh this is a challenge for our next
iterations.
Yeah, thank you. That's a lot. Thank you
so much Ditro.
Okay. So from Drupal 10.5 we are moving
to Drupal 11 which is in progress and
here Angie will share news with us.
Yeah thank you Janna. So with Drupal 11
we are doing really great progress in
local environment. We already have built
uh and uh we are not seeing a lot of
problems with the core which is a good
news. Uh hopefully in next one or two
weeks we'll be releasing alpha version
of Drupal 11. Alpha version won't have
support for upgrade path. It's for early
adopters and for us to be able to
uh present functionalities
in Drupal 11 on development sandboxes.
So we are focusing mostly on small Y
work because in the YMCA community
majority of associations are uh more
smaller than bigger but uh small Y is
almost the same as standard installation
which is covering maybe 80 to 90% of the
installations. So our hope is to release
small Y+ standard as soon as possible
and uh then to work on extended version
to uh and to collect feedback from early
adopters of Drupal 11 and uh maybe some
bug fixes for the upgrade path and after
alpha version is somehow tested we'll be
working on uh stable version of the
distribution to cover majority of
functionalities.
Keep in mind and this is applicable to
Drupal 10.5 as well that based on the
agreement with Y USA since not Y USA but
also with core team since 2024
Lily and Rose themes are deprecated and
in 10.5 as well as Drupal 11 they are
removed from the distribution they still
available so you still can use them. But
as core team uh we are not anymore
support them officially. They are
supported by you, by your organizations,
by your partners. So just keep that in
mind.
What we are working right now is we are
testing Drupal 11 and fixing some bugs.
Major issues come to visic editor
because with Drupal 10.5 with Drupal 11
CK editor version 5 comes in play a lot
of functionalities that we built since
2018 up until now they are now covered
by Drupal core. So do expect that
we'll be removing some of the features
from the distribution in favor of
leveraging what comes with Drupal core
as well as uh and I believe this is for
the next slide. Drupal 11 opens us a lot
of no it's not the next slide so I'll
talk about AI a little bit later. Jeanna
word back to you.
Thank you so much. Yep. Okay. So,
uh we are moving forward. So, next one
is going to be improvements to schedules
which is also related to this upgrades.
And here I believe Ditro will have some
information for us.
Uh yes, this is a quick update. Uh
actually uh the schedules uh are um we
are enhancing the um ability in to use
the uh different names in the uh classes
and uh enable the uh database for the
future integration of AI that can uh
suggest people uh for for some classes
and
This
um allows us to u
see uh sorry to uh make this uh uh
schedules application compatible uh with
all the features and uh the updates to
the syncer also included.
Thanks John.
Thank you so much.
Okay,
so that was main updates uh from us and
now we'd like to discuss what's going to
be next uh preparing for the future. Uh
I named that slide that's about Drupal
10.5 and Drupal 11 and why it's
important. So I think Andre that's what
you are waiting for. Yeah, this is a
sensitive topic and we are not ready to
share any news about AI but one of the
big uh things that are coming to Drupal
and not only to Drupal is integrations
with different
and at this point we are not committing
in the distribution to this we just with
upgrading distribution
we are opening the doors to those
opportunities and right now we are
collecting feedback, initial thoughts,
any ideas or uh demand from associations
to the email that you see on the slide.
So this email been read by Tom Scarbor.
So if you have any ideas, any requests,
please share your thoughts to this
email. And uh later this year or next
year, we'll be hopefully
organizing some workshops, demos,
discussions, what have you. So Drupal 11
is definitely a baseline for the
distribution in Q3, Q4 this year.
uh be ready with you and your partners,
I mean digital partners to upgrade to
this uh uh core. It's more decent, more
flexible. We see performance improvement
a lot with this core. In terms of
functionalities, as Tom said in the
beginning of the call, do not expect a
lot of new functionalities
added specifically to YMCA needs.
Yes, with the core you'll get a lot of
new features that uh supported by Drupal
community. Some of them really important
for YMCA too. But before we are on that
version, we are not going to share any
thoughts about that. Just to keep this
maybe in a secret or just to keep a
momentum to the proper time.
Okay, that's fair.
Thank you so much, Andre.
Okay, so let's move forward and I think
it's a time for Q&A session. We'll be
happy to hear your questions,
suggestions or any feedback you may have
now or maybe later. Feel free to use
that email from previous slide and on
the next one will be also
um yep. So
you can use chat for questions in the
zoom or you can unplug your plug your
microphone and ask question if you have
any.
Hey uh I've got a quick one. Um thanks
for all the work keeping keeping
everything updated. Um, I know in the
past we've had like dev sandboxes and
prod sandboxes. Um, and the prod
sandboxes have been pretty important for
a lot of the community to test things
out. It seems like those have been down
for a couple days. Um, is it possible to
kind of keep the the development
segregated so that the you know the this
the production sandboxes stay um stay up
while the uh we do most of the dev on
the the other side.
Yes. Yes, I'll answer this question.
Thank you, Avi. So, we just released a
10.5
and uh that release broke standards and
boxes. So, it's our top priority and
hopefully tomorrow or day after tomorrow
they will be fix it. And yes, our idea
is that standards and boxes
they will stay
hopefully forever
uh like up and running for you to play
with that. And if something is not
working, if any sandbox is not working,
just ping gas in the channel will
immediately rebuild it. Development
boxes, yes, they will also work. And our
hope in next couple of weeks to get the
Drupal 11 for the developers community
to play with them.
Thanks.
Okay. Thank you so much, Avi.
Also, I'd like to ask maybe Tom Scarboro
or Sandep or Tom Gardner if he's on the
call would like to say a few words or
add anything.
Yeah, nothing additional on my end. Uh I
don't know if uh you had anything you
wanted to jump in on, Sandy.
Yeah. Um good good work IT care team. Um
I was just going to say that uh you know
we are committed to the core updates in
2025 which is upgrade to Drupal 10.5 and
11 support small Y template and ensure
that the distribution is passion
secured. Um again the plans for 2026 are
still being developed so we can speak to
speak speak to them at this time. Uh so
we expect to have some more clarity soon
on that and we'll share updates with the
community as they become available.
Oh, thank you.
Okay,
thank you so much. If you'll have
questions later, feel free to reach out
and use this email as we have a plenty
of places where you can stay in touch
with us and ask your questions. Uh so as
a reminder,
Yep. Go ahead. Sorry Z, I think Demitri
has a question to you.
Go ahead.
Tom, you want to take that or do you
want me to?
I I I can take that. So, Dimmitri, for
2025, uh the scope for distribution was
pretty narrow. As I just said, uh we
were committed to the core updates,
support for small Y template, and
ensuring that the distribution is
secured and patched. If you have ideas
for the road map um you know you can
always share that with the team uh
ycloud yca.net
um and you know our door is open if you
would like to have a discussion with ITK
or Yusa about uh you know a specific um
specific strategy or specific change
that that you think is important. We'll
be more than happy to hear about that.
So um I just want to be clear that it's
not that the door is shut on the
partners. welcome feedback as Andre said
that you know these upgrades kind of
opened the door for future updates which
I want to be very very clear that YUSS
scope for 2025 was was limited to just
the core updates and for 2026 we don't
know yet um so yeah if and and and we
welcome feedback so yeah if you if you
want to reach out to IT care or yusa
with uh you know any uh and and share
your thoughts you're more than welcome
to do Yeah,
thank you so much.
Yeah, we're still keeping Slack channels
monitoring.
So, uh it's all under Tom Scarbor
overview. So, nothing is missed. Uh no
problems with you asking directly why
you say nothing locked to ITR only. It
just it is what it is 2025.
Yeah.
Well, as a reminder, um, DS YMCorg,
that's, uh, the YMCA digital services
website. Here you'll find information,
the latest one. DS docs yorg
