The YMCA Website Services platform is a content management system (CMS) that leverages Drupal's robust functionality, enhanced with a suite of modules developed by YMCAs and their digital partners. This platform is designed to be both user-friendly and freely accessible, encouraging widespread adoption and collaborative project development within the YMCA community.

## History

YMCA Website Services was established in 2016 by a collective of YMCA digital, marketing, and technology professionals who recognized the potential for synergistic digital advancement through community collaboration.

Until 2022, a core team consisting of representatives from several YMCAs, including the [YMCA of the North (formerly Greater Twin Cities)](https://ymcanorth.org), [Greater Seattle](http://www.seattleymca.org), and [Greater Houston](https://www.ymcahouston.org), steered the platform's development. Subsequently, ownership transitioned to [YMCA of the USA's Digital Services](https://ds.ymca.org).

## Current Governance

The current core team, comprising Y-USA, [ITCare](https://itcare.company), [ImageX](https://imagexmedia.com), and [Five Jars](https://fivejars.com), is responsible for:

-   Covering the operational costs associated with managing YMCA Website Services.
-   Maintaining and updating the YMCA Website Services content management system.
-   Ensuring that all basic functionalities within the CMS remain accessible without charge; contributions are shared freely within the community.
-   Proactively identifying and addressing issues within the YMCA Website Services CMS.
-   **Disclaimer:** The core team is not liable for bugs, crashes, or performance issues affecting the CMS.
-   Vetting and approving new digital partners to join the community.
-   Providing training resources for YMCA Website Services Specialists, who are digital partners possessing extensive platform expertise.
-   Offering certification for YMCA Website Services Integrators, digital partners with the capability to install and directly modify the codebase.
-   Disseminating information and updates regarding YMCA Website Services.
-   Organizing community events to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Inspiration

YMCA Website Services draws inspiration from the [Thunder Coalition](http://www.thunder.org) model used in the publishing industry, adopting similar concepts and content strategies.
