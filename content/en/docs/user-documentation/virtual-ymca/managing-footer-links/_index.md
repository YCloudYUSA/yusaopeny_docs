title: Managing Footer Links
---

Your standalone Virtual Y site may have a block with social media links at the bottom of the page. These links can be customized for many social media services.

## Getting to the Block Editor

Your site may have a "Quick Edit" icon (a tiny pencil) that appears when you hover over the section with the links. If so, click the pencil, then **Edit**.

**OR**

If you don't see the Quick Edit option, you can navigate to the Block editor via the admin menu at **Structure** > **Block Layout** > **Custom Block Library** > **Edit Footer Social Block**.

### Editing Links

1.  Select the text you want to link, or double-click an existing link to modify it.
2.  In the **URL** field, add the complete URL to the social media site.
3.  Edit the **Title** field to something more descriptive; this will be used as the `title` attribute for accessibility.
4.  Open the **Advanced** section and update the **CSS classes** field to select the correct icon. Be sure to copy the *entire* code snippet below for the icon you want. These CSS classes use Font Awesome icons.

    *   Facebook: `fa fa-facebook`
    *   Twitter: `fa fa-twitter`
    *   YouTube: `fa fa-youtube`
    *   Instagram: `fa fa-instagram`
    *   Vimeo: `fa fa-vimeo`
    *   [Many other options](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free) (ensure you select a free icon).

    > Note: The available icons may depend on the version of Font Awesome included with your site theme.
