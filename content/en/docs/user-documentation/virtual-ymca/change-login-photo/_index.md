Please follow these steps if you wish to customize the photo users will see when they log into the Virtual Y site.

To update the image *before* the user logs in:

1.  Log into the site as a Site Owner.
2.  Go to **Manage > Content** (click directly on Content, not one of its sub-menus).
3.  In the content grid, find "Virtual YMCA Login" and click the **Edit** button for that row.
4.  Expand the "Header Area".
5.  Click the **Edit** button next to the "Banner" row.

6.  Expand the "Image" section. Locate the current image and click the **Remove** button underneath it (not the Edit button).

7.  Re-expand the "Image" section and click the **Select Images** button.
8.  If the desired image is not already in the system, click the **Upload images** link to add it.
9.  If the image is already in the system, select it and click **Select media**.

10. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**.

If you also want to modify the image the user sees *after* they log in, repeat the steps above, but in step #3, find "Virtual YMCA" instead of "Virtual YMCA Login".
