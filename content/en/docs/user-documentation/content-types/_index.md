A **content type** is a reusable container for content. Content types have a common structure and purpose. They support site architecture and make content presentation consistent. This helps people find what they need.

There are two different kinds of Content Types in the distribution:

- **Standalone types** are content that is displayed directly to users, like Landing Pages and Branches. They may also be displayed in views or other groupings.
- **Helper types** are content that is never displayed on its own to users. It is displayed in aggregate or as part of a supporting application like Activity Finder or Membership Calculator.

Most sites will be built using a combination of these content types. The right content type for your content will depend on how it will be used and displayed. Landing Pages will often make up the bulk of your site, but you may also need to create Events, Articles, Branches, and other content types to support your site's goals.

## Which Content Type Should I Use?

Before you begin building your site, you should have a good idea of what kind of content you will be creating. Consider conducting a [content audit](../../howto/content-audit) to understand what content you have and what content you need to create.

Once you begin building your site, you will most likely start building Landing Pages. These are the most flexible content type and can be used for a wide variety of content.

Location pages like Branches and Camps are also important to build out, as they will be used to promote each individual location.

Finally, you can create supporting content types like Events and Articles to provide more timely information to your users.

## Standalone Content Types

These content types are built for Layout Builder or are Layout Builder-compatible when the supporting module is enabled:

- [Article (Layout Builder)](./lb-article)
- [Event (Layout Builder)](./lb-event)
- [Branch](./branch)
- [Camp](./camp)
- [Facility](./facility)
- [Landing Page (Layout Builder)](./lb-landing-page)
- [Program](./program)
- [Program Subcategory](./program-subcategory)
- [Promotion](./promotion)

These content types use the legacy Paragraphs page builder:

- [Blog Post](./blog-post)
- [Landing Page](./landing-page)
- [News Post](./news-post)


## Helper Content Types

These content types help are not displayed on their own, but are used in supporting applications:

- [Activity, Class, and Session](./activity-class-session)
- [Alert](./alert)
- [Membership](./membership)
