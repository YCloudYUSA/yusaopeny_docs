  YMCA Website Services features many different kinds of pages, or content types. Choosing the right content type will ensure you collect the right information and allow you the flexibility to create layouts.

A **content type** is a reusable container for content, defining its structure and purpose. Utilizing content types supports consistent site architecture and content presentation, helping users efficiently find what they need. In Drupal terminology, content types are entity sub-types for the "Content item" entity type, allowing each content type to have its own fields and display settings.

There are two main categories of Content Types in the YMCA Website Services distribution:

-   **Standalone types:** These content types are designed to be displayed directly to users as individual pages. Examples include Landing Pages and Branches. They can also be displayed in views or other groupings.
-   **Helper types:** These content types are not typically displayed on their own. Instead, they are used to support applications or to display aggregated information, such as within the Activity Finder or Membership Calculator.

Most sites utilize a combination of these content types. The appropriate content type depends on how the content will be used and displayed. While Landing Pages often constitute the majority of a site's content, other types like Events, Articles, and Branches may be necessary to achieve specific site goals.

## Choosing the Right Content Type

Before building your site, identify the types of content you'll be creating. A [content audit](../../howto/content-audit) can help you understand your existing content and identify what new content needs to be developed.

Landing Pages are often the starting point for site construction due to their flexibility. They can accommodate a wide range of content.

Location pages, such as Branches and Camps, are also important for promoting individual locations.

Supporting content types like Events and Articles provide timely information to users.

## Standalone Content Types

These content types are designed for use with Layout Builder or are compatible with Layout Builder when the supporting module is enabled:

-   [Article (Layout Builder)](./lb-article)
-   [Event (Layout Builder)](./lb-event)
-   [Branch](./branch)
-   [Camp](./camp)
-   [Facility](./facility)
-   [Landing Page (Layout Builder)](./lb-landing-page)
-   [Program](./program)
-   [Program Subcategory](./program-subcategory)
-   [Promotion](./promotion)

These content types use the legacy Paragraphs page builder:

-   [Blog Post](./blog-post)
-   [Landing Page](./landing-page)
-   [News Post](./news-post)

## Helper Content Types

These content types are not displayed on their own but are used in supporting applications:

-   [Activity, Class, and Session](./activity-class-session)
-   [Alert](./alert)
-   [Membership](./membership)
