### Fields in Landing Page

#### Title (Required)

This is what you will see in your admin portal as your content's name. It will also show as the page title in the Header unless you add a paragraph in the *Header Area*. The title will appear in the `<title>` tag of the HTML, which is important for SEO and accessibility.

#### Layout (Required)

Landing Pages come with four basic layouts for desktop. For mobile, all layouts display in a single column, with the *Sidebar Area* stacking below the *Content Area*.

#### One Column Layout

### Paragraph Areas

You can use any number of [Paragraphs](../../paragraphs) in these fields. Paragraphs are reusable content components that can be added to various areas of your landing page.

*   **Header Area**: Used for inserting banners, small banners, and galleries. Date blocks are also great in this area for scheduled content. This area appears at the very top of the page.
*   **Content Area**: The main body of your content. This is where the primary information and messaging of your landing page should be placed.
*   **Sidebar Area** *(Two Column Layouts Only)*: For aside pieces of content, such as side navigations, promotional cards, and content related to the main part of your page. This area is only visible when using a two-column layout.
*   **Bottom Area**: Add an anchoring element to your page, such as a promotional banner or webform. This area appears at the bottom of the page.
