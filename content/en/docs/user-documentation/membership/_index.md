The distribution offers a couple of ways to present membership options to visitors and direct them to the appropriate membership management system (MMS) for signup.

## Methods for Informing Visitors

The two primary methods for informing visitors about membership options involve:

1.  **Membership Content Type:** This content type allows you to create individual pages detailing specific membership offerings. These pages can be linked to from other areas of your site.
2.  **Membership Calculator Paragraph:** This paragraph type, when added to a page, creates an interactive wizard that guides users through selecting a membership. See [Membership Calculator Paragraph](../../membership/calculator) and [Membership Content Type](../../content-types/membership) for more information.

## Finding Your Registration Link

Every membership management system will have different ways of linking for members to complete their registration. Here are a few we know about. If you have tips for an MMS not listed here, feel free to leave them in the comments.

### Daxko Operations

Navigate to: **Membership** > **Membership Types** > **Edit** > **Online Settings**. This provides the deep link to the specific membership types.
