## How to Use News Posts

![The news posts listing admin](paragraphs--news-posts-listing--admin.png)

From the paragraphs dropdown, add the *News Posts Listing*. Enter a header title for the section in the text field and hit *Save*.

> ***Note:** Advanced users can make changes to the exposed fields using the Views module and the paragraphs settings.* This requires advanced knowledge of Drupal's Views and Paragraphs modules.

## Content Types that Support News Posts

*   [Landing Page](../../content-types/landing-page)
*   [Branch (not recommended)](../../content-types/branch)
*   [Camp (not recommended)](../../content-types/camp)
*   Facility (not recommended)

> It is generally **not recommended** to use the News Post Listing on Branch, Camp or Facility pages due to the availability of the Latest News Posts/(Camp)/(Branch) paragraph.
