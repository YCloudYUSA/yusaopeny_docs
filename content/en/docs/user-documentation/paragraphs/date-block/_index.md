## How to Use Date Blocks

1.  In the desired content area, choose **Add Date Block** from the list of paragraphs in the dropdown menu.
2.  You will then see two options: **Add New Custom Block** or **Add Existing Custom Block**.

### Add New Custom Block

If you are using Date Block for the first time or want to create a new, unique date block:

1.  Choose the **Add New Custom Block** option.

2.  Enter a descriptive **Label** for your date block in the **Block description** field.

    *   This label is for administrative purposes and will help you identify the block when reusing it on multiple pages. It is not displayed on the front end of the site.
3.  Enter a **Start Date** and **End Date** for your block.

    *   The content within the date block will only be visible between these dates, similar to how content types can be scheduled for publishing and unpublishing.

4.  Add paragraphs to the designated areas to display content *Before*, *During*, and *After* your scheduled dates.

    *   Use the corresponding fields and add paragraphs as you normally would.
