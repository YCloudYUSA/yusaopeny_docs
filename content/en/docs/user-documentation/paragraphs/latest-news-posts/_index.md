title: Latest News Posts
description: Embed a listing of news posts with optional filtering by Camp/Branch.
---

These paragraphs embed listings of news posts, sorted by the most recent, in a row/listing design. There are three variations:

*   **Latest News Posts:** Displays all the most recent news posts across your entire site.
*   **Latest News Posts (Branch):** Filters news posts by the branch on which the paragraph is embedded. For example, if placed on a "Downtown YMCA" page, only "Downtown YMCA" news posts will be shown. If placed on a non-branch page, only the headline will be displayed.
*   **Latest News Posts (Camp):** Filters news posts by the camp on which the paragraph is embedded. For example, if placed on a "Camp Widjiwagan" page, only "Camp Widjiwagan YMCA" news posts will be shown. If placed on a non-camp page, only the headline will be displayed.
