> [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) services have been deprecated as of 5/31/23, and this block ceased functioning on that date.

This block is no longer functional due to the discontinuation of AddThis services.

See [Using AddToAny](../../../howto/add-social-feeds/#using-addtoany) for a recommended replacement and other options for sharing content.

For integrating social media feeds, also consider the [Social Feed Fetcher module](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_feed_fetcher).
