## How to Use Webform

> **Prerequisite**: You must have your web form created before embedding it onto a page. You can continue to revise and edit your form after embedding, but this process will NOT create a webform for you.

Once you’ve selected *Webform* from the paragraphs dropdown, select the name of the webform you want to embed onto your page.

Next, you will have the option to open, close, or schedule open/close dates for your webform.

> The "Default submission pairs" field allows you to pre-populate certain fields in your webform with default values if users leave them blank. Unless you have advanced knowledge of YAML, it is not recommended to configure this field.
