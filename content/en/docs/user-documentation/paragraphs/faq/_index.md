## Structured Data for SEO

If your FAQ contains Frequently Asked Questions, consider enabling the "FAQ?" option within the paragraph to output them as structured data. This can improve your site's visibility in search engine results. Ensure the content contains individual sets of questions and answers.

> Review [Google's Content guidelines for FAQs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage#content-guidelines) for more information.

> Only one FAQ paragraph should be added to a page to ensure correct structured data output.
