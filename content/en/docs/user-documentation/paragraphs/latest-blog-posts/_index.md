title: Latest Blog Posts
description: Embed a listing of blog posts with optional filtering by Branch or Camp.
---

These paragraphs embed a listing of blog posts, sorted by the most recent, in a card design. They utilize a dynamic paragraph that renders blog posts.

*   **Latest Blog Posts:** Shows the most recent blog posts across your entire site.
*   **Latest Blog Posts (Branch):** Filters the most recent blog posts by the branch the paragraph is embedded on. For example, if placed on a "Downtown YMCA" page, only "Downtown YMCA" blog posts will be displayed. If placed on a non-branch page, only the headline will be shown.
*   **Latest Blog Posts (Camp):** Filters blog posts by the camp the paragraph is embedded on. For example, if placed on a "Camp Widjiwagan" page, only "Camp Widjiwagan YMCA" blog posts will be displayed. If placed on a non-camp page, only the headline will be shown.
