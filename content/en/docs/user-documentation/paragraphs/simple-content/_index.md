## How to Use Simple Content

The Simple Content paragraph allows you to add and format text using the WYSIWYG editor. This provides a flexible way to add basic content to your pages.

1.  From the paragraphs dropdown within the desired area (Content, Sidebar, or Bottom), select *Add Simple Content*.
2.  A text editor will appear. You can style your text using the editor's toolbar. This toolbar typically includes options for:

    *   **Basic Formatting:** Bold, Italics, Underline, Strikethrough
    *   **Alignment:** Left, Center, Right, Justify
    *   **Lists:** Bulleted and Numbered
    *   **Headings:** H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
    *   **Links:** Adding and editing hyperlinks
    *   **Other:** Blockquotes, source editing, special characters and more.

    Refer to the [Text Editor documentation](../../text-editor) for details on using the editor toolbar.

> **Note:** In some themes, stacking multiple Simple Content paragraphs directly on top of one another may not provide enough visual separation.
>
> To address this, consider adding:
>
> *   A pair of hard returns (pressing the Enter key twice) at the bottom of your text.
> *   A horizontal rule (using the horizontal line option in the text editor toolbar) to visually divide the sections.
