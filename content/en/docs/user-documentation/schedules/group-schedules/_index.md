Sometimes called "Group Exercise" or "Group Schedules", the **Repeat Schedules** block provides a similar view to Activity Finder, but focused more on recurring, often drop-in classes. You can see [an example of this on our sandbox site](https://sandbox-carnation-cus.y.org/schedules-0).

Developers can find more information in [`ynorth-project/openy_repeat`](https://github.com/ynorth-projects/openy_repeat) and [Program Event Framework](../../../development/program-event-framework).
