# Adding/Embedding Videos with the YMCA Website Services Text Editor

YMCA Website Services allows you to upload and embed videos directly into a block of text, either from a supported external source (like YouTube or Vimeo) by pasting the video URL or from the YMCA Website Services media library.

## Adding Videos from an External Source

1.  Click the **Embed media** button (usually a filmstrip icon) in the text editor toolbar.
2.  In the **Source URL** field, paste the URL of the video you want to embed.
3.  Hit **Save** to embed the video. The editor will automatically generate a preview of the video.

## Adding Videos from the Media Library

1.  Click the **Media** button (if available, may look like an image icon or filmstrip) in the text editor toolbar.
2.  In the Media library popup, select the video you want to embed.
3.  (Optional) Configure the video's display settings.
4.  Click **Embed** or **Insert** to add the video to your content.

## Configuring Video Display Options

After embedding your video, you may be able to adjust additional options. *Note: These options depend on the configuration of your specific YMCA Website Services instance and may not all be available.*

*   **Entity Name:** This field displays the name of your video.
*   **Display as:** This setting controls the size and appearance of the video within your content area. Available options might include:

    *   **Full:** The video will fill the width of its container.
    *   **Half:** The video will take up half the width of its container.
    *   **Link:** The video will be displayed as a text link to the video file.
*   **Link to:** This option wraps the video in a link, allowing you to specify a destination URL that users will be directed to when they click on the video.
*   **Align:** Use this setting to float the video to the left, right, or center of the page, allowing text to wrap around it.
*   **Caption:** Adds a descriptive caption below the video.

When you are satisfied with the video's settings, click **Embed**.

> *If you want to make changes to the video you just embedded after you've added it, double click on the video placeholder in the editor, and the "Embed media" dialogue will appear.*
