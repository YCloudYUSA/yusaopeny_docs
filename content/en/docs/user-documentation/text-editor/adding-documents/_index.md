YMCA Website Services allows you to upload and embed documents directly into a block of text, either from your computer or from the YMCA Website Services media library and browser.

## Adding Documents

*   To add a document, click on the document button (usually represented by a paperclip or document icon) in the text editor toolbar.
*   Make sure you're on the *"Add Document"* or *"Upload"* tab.
*   Next, name your document.
*   Paste the document URL into the appropriate field, or upload the document from your computer.
*   Hit "Save" to proceed.

## Adding Documents from the Media Library

*   To add a document from the media library, click on the document icon in the text editor toolbar.
*   Next, click on the tab that says *"Media Library"* or *"All Documents"*.
*   Select the desired document from the library.
*   Name your document, tag it, and write your alt description as needed.
*   Hit "Save" to proceed.

## Sizing and Floating Your Document

After you save your document to the media library, a dialogue box will appear, giving you some additional options for embedding it inline. These options may vary depending on your specific configuration. Common options include:

*   **Entity Name:** This is simply the name of your document, which you provided earlier.
*   **Display as:** This option allows you to change the size or format of the document display without affecting the original document. By default, YMCA Website Services may offer *Full, Half, and Link* display modes:
    *   **Full:** Your document fills the available area where it's inserted.
    *   **Half:** The document is displayed at half the size of its available area.
    *   **Link:** The document is output as a simple text link to the document file.
*   **Link to:**  This option wraps the document (or the link, if "Display as Link" is selected) in a hyperlink. When users click on the document, they will be directed to the specified URL.
*   **Align:** This allows you to float the document to the left, center, or right of the page.
*   **Caption:** This option adds a descriptive caption below the embedded document or link.

When you're ready to embed the document, click "Embed." You can also click the back button to choose a different document.

> *If you want to make changes to the document you just embedded after you've added it, double click on the icon, and the "Embed media" dialogue will appear. Note that the exact wording of the dialogue box may vary.*
