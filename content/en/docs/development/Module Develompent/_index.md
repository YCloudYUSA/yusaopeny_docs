## Module Content Removal

When deleting an entity where plugins or services of the removing module are used, content removal should be done in the `hook_uninstall()` function of that module. This ensures that no orphaned data or references remain in the system after the module is uninstalled.

**Example:**

See `openy_prgf_camp_menu.install` for an example of how to implement this. The `hook_uninstall()` function in this file removes paragraphs before the module uninstall to avoid errors related to missing services used in the camp menu block.

## Creating a New Module

When creating a new module on Drupal.org, ensure the following:

1.  **Add all current maintainers:** Properly credit and involve all individuals actively contributing to the module.
2.  **Add a module template:**  This template provides essential information and resources for users. Use the following HTML snippet and customize it for your module:

```html
<table class="views-view-grid" bgcolor="#d4efcc">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h2>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</h2>
    </td>
    <td>
      This module is maintained by Ukrainian developers. Please consider
      <a href="https://supportukrainenow.org">supporting Ukraine</a> in a fight for their freedom and the safety of Europe.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
