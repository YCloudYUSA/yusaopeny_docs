# Developing Themes

Each YMCA Website Services theme was developed independently, either by the YMCA Website Services Core Team or by a partner for a specific Y and then contributed back. You can see demos of each theme on the [Sandboxes]({{< relref "Sandboxes.md" >}}).

Each theme has its own dependencies and build processes. Refer to the `README` file within each theme's project for specific instructions.

## Theme Inventory

As of December 2021, themes have been decoupled from the YMCA Website Services profile and exist as independent projects on Drupal.org.
