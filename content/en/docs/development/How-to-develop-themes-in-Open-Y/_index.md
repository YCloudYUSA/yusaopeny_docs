# Working with Themes

Each YMCA Website Services theme was developed independently, either by the YMCA Website Services Core Team or by a partner for one specific Y and then contributed back. You can see demos of each theme on the [Sandboxes]({{< relref "Sandboxes.md" >}}).

Each theme has its own dependencies and build processes. Please read the steps in each `README` for details.

## Inventory of themes

As of December 2021, themes [have been decoupled](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny/pull/2595) from the YMCA Website Services profile to independent projects on Drupal.org.

### Carnation (Current)

- [openy_carnation project](https://www.drupal.org/project/openy_carnation) on Drupal.org
- [README](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/openy_carnation) for getting started with development

### Lily and Rose (Deprecated in Drupal 11)

**Note:** The Lily and Rose themes have been removed from Drupal 11 distributions. For Drupal 11 implementations, use Carnation theme.

For legacy Drupal 10 sites still using these themes:
- [openy_lily project](https://www.drupal.org/project/openy_lily) on Drupal.org
- [openy_rose project](https://www.drupal.org/project/openy_rose) on Drupal.org
