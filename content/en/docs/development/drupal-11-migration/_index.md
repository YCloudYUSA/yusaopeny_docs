## Before You Upgrade

**Important:** This is a **beta release**. Only upgrade if:
- You're testing for bugs before the stable Q4 2025 release
- You have a staging environment for testing
- You're comfortable troubleshooting potential issues

**Most YMCAs should remain on Drupal 10** until the stable Drupal 11 release in Q4 2025.

---

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading to Drupal 11:

1. **Update to latest Drupal 10:** Ensure you're on Drupal 10.3.x or higher
2. **Upgrade PHP:** Update server to PHP 8.3 or higher
3. **Backup everything:** Database, files, and code
4. **Test on staging:** Never upgrade production directly

## Known Issues

### jQuery 3.x Script Compatibility

**Issue:** Drupal 11 uses jQuery 3.x, which breaks some legacy jQuery 1.x/2.x scripts.

**Solution:** As of version **11.1.0.0-alpha2**, YMCA Website Services includes jQuery Migrate to provide backward compatibility.

**What this means:**
- Legacy jQuery syntax (jQuery 1.x/2.x) continues to work with jQuery 3.x
- Custom JavaScript and third-party libraries maintain compatibility
- No immediate action required for most sites

**For developers with custom JavaScript:**
- Test your custom modules with jQuery 3.x
- Update deprecated jQuery methods when possible
- jQuery Migrate provides console warnings about deprecated code
