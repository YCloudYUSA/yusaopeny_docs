title: Bootstrap version support for Activity Finder
---

The Carnation theme utilizes Bootstrap v4.6. To accommodate this, the Activity Finder v4 module includes a "Bootstrap version" setting located at `/admin/openy/settings/activity-finder`.

The Rose and Lily themes use Bootstrap v3, while the Carnation theme is built with Bootstrap v4.  Setting the "Bootstrap version" to "4" ensures that the Activity Finder v4 result page displays correctly on tablet screens within the Carnation theme.
