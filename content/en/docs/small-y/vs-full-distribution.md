## What Can Be Added to Small Y?

**Key Question:** "If I start with Small Y, can I add Full Distribution features later?"

**Answer:** YES! Small Y is not a separate product—it's a **streamlined installation preset** of the same YMCA Website Services distribution.

**Important:** Once you install Small Y, you have access to **everything** available in Full Distribution. All modules from Full Distribution are available to enable—you're not locked into a limited feature set. The only difference is which modules are enabled by default.

### Modules You Can Add to Small Y

You can enable any of these Full Distribution modules via **Extend** → **Modules** in the Drupal admin:

| Feature | Module to Enable | Complexity |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Program Event Framework** | `openy_prgf_*` modules | Medium - Requires configuration |
| **Blog Posts (legacy)** | `openy_node_blog` | Easy |
| **News Posts (legacy)** | `openy_node_news` | Easy |
| **Facility content type** | `openy_node_facility` | Easy |
| **Program content type** | `openy_node_program` | Medium |
| **Legacy Paragraphs** | `paragraphs`, `openy_prgf_*` | Medium - Training needed |
| **Virtual YMCA** | `openy_gated_content` | Advanced - Separate setup |
| **Membership Framework** | `openy_memberships` | Advanced - Drupal Commerce |

**Performance Impact:** Each module you add increases:
- Page load time (+50-200ms per module)
- Database size (+10-50MB per module)
- Update complexity (more modules = more updates to test)

**Styling Considerations:** Some Full Distribution modules may require additional theme work:
- 🎨 **Theme compatibility** - Modules designed for legacy themes (Lily/Rose) may need Carnation theme styling adjustments
- 🔧 **Custom CSS** - Minor CSS tweaks may be needed for optimal appearance
- 💻 **Development time** - Budget 2-8 hours for styling work per complex module
- ✅ **Solution** - Work with a developer or agency partner to ensure proper integration

### What You CANNOT Add

❌ **Different installation presets** - Once installed, you can't switch from Small Y preset to Full preset without reinstalling
❌ **Demo content after installation** - Demo content is only available during initial installation
❌ **Past Drupal versions** - Small Y requires Drupal 11.1+

## Migration Paths

### Can You Migrate Between Them?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch from Small Y to Full Distribution later?

Yes, but it's not an "upgrade"—it's enabling additional modules. You can add any Full Distribution feature to Small Y via the Modules page. However, there's no single "switch to Full Distribution" button.

**Best Practice:** Start with Small Y, add modules only when you need them.

### Does Small Y support the same CRM integrations?

Yes! Both support:
- Daxko Operations
- ActiveNet
- Personify

The CRM integration modules are available in both installations.

### Will Small Y be supported long-term?

Yes. Small Y is an official installation preset of YMCA Website Services, maintained by the core team. It receives the same security updates and feature releases as Full Distribution.

**Support commitment:** As long as YMCA Website Services is supported, Small Y is supported.

### What if I outgrow Small Y?

Two options:
1. **Enable additional modules** - Add features as needed (recommended)
2. **Migrate to fresh Full Distribution install** - Only if you need to completely restructure

Most YMCAs find option 1 sufficient.

### Can I use legacy Paragraphs with Small Y?

Yes, but you'll need to enable the Paragraphs modules. Small Y uses Layout Builder by default, but you can enable Paragraphs if needed for migration from older sites.

### How many content editors can use Small Y?

Both Small Y and Full Distribution support unlimited users. User limits depend on your hosting plan, not the installation type.

**Our Recommendation:** When in doubt, start with Small Y Template.

**Why?**
- ✅ Faster launch

- ✅ Better performance from day one

You can always enable more modules as your needs grow. It's harder to simplify a complex Full Distribution install than to expand a Small Y install.
