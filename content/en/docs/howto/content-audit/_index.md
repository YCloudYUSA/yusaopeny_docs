Doing a content audit is a useful first step in planning a migration or a larger content strategy initiative. A content audit helps you understand the current state of your website, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about your content.

You can use our [content audit template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kP4JuXEKP6SFZHzqkUmv1KoTGECFOYaTPzgOc0Lyo-c/edit#gid=0) and watch our walkthrough on the [May Monthly Call](https://youtu.be/Dtaeo9Mf6Ac?t=251) to get started. Then follow these steps:

## Audit

List all current website pages in a spreadsheet, organized by menu section or information architecture.

-   This will give you a visual overview of how your site is structured.
    -   Be sure to audit your Drupal Admin back end for unpublished pages that can be removed or deleted!

## Review

Visit each page and review the content.

-   Identify key pages and content types.
-   Locate content that is outdated, duplicated, needs further review, or could benefit from consolidation.
-   Find content gaps and identify what might be missing.
-   Identify commonly used page components (i.e., Cards, Carousels, Accordions).
-   Note the text formats being used. Text formats are managed by the core Filter module and define how text is filtered and displayed. See the [Managing text filters and text formats](core.content_structure) help topic for more information.
