title: News Posts Listing
---

This dynamic paragraph renders the latest news posts and utilizes exposed filters, allowing users to refine the displayed content.

The available filters are:

*   Location
*   Category
*   Text

The News Posts Listing also features a "sticky at the top" option, ensuring important news remains visible. Items are ordered by published date, with the newest posts appearing first. This functionality relies on the Views module.
