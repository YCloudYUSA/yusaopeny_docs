| Left Column    | field_prgf_left_column_block  | No       | A block reference field for the left column, often used for a secondary description.  You can select from existing blocks or create a new one. Supported block types: Basic Block, Code Block, Date Block, or Simple Block.                                   |
| Right Column   | field_prgf_right_column_block | No       | A block reference field for the right column, typically used as a sidebar.  You can select from existing blocks or create a new one.

**Note:** Blocks provide a modular way to organize and display content within the columns. Consider using Basic Blocks for standard text and media, Code Blocks for displaying code snippets, Date Blocks for event dates, and Simple Blocks for streamlined content elements. You can create these blocks in the "Blocks" section of the administrative interface. The "Block Content" module allows you to manage block types and content blocks. The block description is an identification name for a block, which is shown in the administrative interface and not displayed on the site. The block title is the heading that is optionally shown to site visitors when the block is placed in a region.
