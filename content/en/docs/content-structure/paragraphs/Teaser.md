### Usage

Teaser paragraphs are commonly used on landing pages, content hubs, and in listing pages to promote specific articles, products, or sections of a website. They provide a concise overview and encourage users to explore further. The `field_prgf_link` will take the user to the page that the Teaser is promoting.

### Best Practices

*   **Image Dimensions:** Use appropriately sized images to ensure optimal display and page load times.
*   **Concise Descriptions:** Keep descriptions brief and focused on highlighting the key benefits or features of the linked content.
*   **Clear Call to Action:**  The link text should clearly indicate the destination and encourage user interaction (e.g., "Read More," "Learn More," "View Details").
