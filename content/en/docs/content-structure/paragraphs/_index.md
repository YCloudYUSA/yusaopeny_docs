Welcome to YMCA Website Services Paragraphs.

Paragraphs are content components, aligning with [component-based design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering#Software_component) principles. Within the YMCA Website Services architecture, paragraphs are based on the [Paragraphs Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs). This module enables the creation of Paragraphs entities.

The core idea is to provide a user-friendly widget for adding predefined content blocks directly within a page or other content item, without needing to reference external entities. It's important to note that paragraphs are not intended as reusable content types. For reusable content, consider using `blocks` or other `entities` within Drupal.

Paragraphs enhance the user experience by offering a convenient and structured way to build content. They allow content editors to create unique layouts for their pages. Each paragraph represents a distinct content section, complete with its own styling, functionality, and fields.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

*   **Paragraphs Module:** Facilitates the creation of paragraph entities within Drupal.

*   **Component-Based Design:** Paragraphs align with the principle of building interfaces from independent, reusable components.

*   **User Experience (UX):** Paragraphs are designed to make content creation more intuitive and efficient.

*   **Non-Reusable Types:** Paragraphs are not designed to be reused across multiple content items. Instead, look at Drupal blocks or entities.

*   **Paragraphs Types**: Paragraphs are pre-defined sets of fields that are made available to the content editors. These are configured under Structure > Paragraphs Types.

To get started with Paragraphs:

1.  Install the Paragraphs module.
2.  Create Paragraphs types.
3.  Add a Paragraph field to a content type.
4.  Begin creating content and adding paragraphs.
