## What are Blocks?

Blocks are boxes of content rendered into a specific area, or region, of a web page. Blocks are placed and configured specifically for each theme, allowing for customization of content display and layout. Think of them as reusable content containers.

## What are Content Blocks?

Content blocks are a specific type of block, where you can edit the content directly through the administrative interface. You can define one or more *block types* and attach fields to each block type, enabling structured content creation for blocks. Content blocks can be placed just like blocks provided by other modules.

## What is the Block Description?

The block description is an administrative label for a block, which is displayed in the administrative interface to help identify the block. It is *not* displayed to site visitors on the live website.

## What is the Block Title?

The block title is the heading that is optionally displayed to site visitors when the block is placed in a region.  The visibility of the title can be configured within the block's settings.

## Managing Blocks

The *Block* module allows you to place existing blocks in regions of your installed themes and configure various block settings, such as title visibility, and user roles. The *Block Content* module allows you to manage custom block types and create/edit their content.
