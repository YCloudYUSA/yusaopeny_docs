## Step 2: Choose Your Solution Path

Before evaluating costs, understand which offering fits your YMCA best.

### Small Y Template (Recommended for Most) ⭐

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <i class="fas fa-star me-2"></i><strong>Recommended:</strong> 70% of new YMCA implementations choose Small Y Template for its simplicity, modern design, and lower maintenance requirements.
</div>

**Best for:**

**What's included:**
- Modern Lily design system (clean, accessible)
- Layout Builder (drag-and-drop page building)
- Essential content types only
- Streamlined configuration
- Better performance and lower hosting costs
- Faster security updates

**Typical deployment:** 4-8 weeks with agency support

[**→ Learn more about Small Y Template**](/docs/small-y/)

### Full Distribution

**Best for:**
- Large YMCAs with complex needs (6+ branches)
- Multiple sub-brands or unique branch sites

- Need maximum customization
- Already using the full platform

**What's included:**
- All YMCA Website Services features

| **Setup Complexity** | ⭐ Simple | ⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Deployment Time** | 4-8 weeks | 3-6 months |
| **Maintenance** | Lower | Higher |
| **Technical Resources** | Minimal | Moderate-High |
| **Customization** | Moderate | Maximum |
| **Best for Branches** | 1-5 | 6+ |
| **Hosting Costs** | $50-300/mo | $200-500/mo |

---

## Step 3: Evaluate Total Cost of Ownership

### One-Time Costs

**Initial Setup (with agency partner):**

|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Hosting** | $50-300/mo | $200-500/mo |
| **Maintenance** | $200-500/mo | $500-1,500/mo |
| **Content updates** | In-house staff | In-house staff |
| **Security updates** | Included in maintenance | Included in maintenance |

**Total annual operating cost:**

### Cost Comparison vs. Alternatives

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <i class="fas fa-info-circle me-2"></i><strong>Cost Estimate Disclaimer:</strong> The following cost comparisons are approximate estimates provided for reference only and are intended to serve as a template for discussion and planning with your chosen digital partner. Actual costs will vary significantly based on your specific needs, geographic location, agency partner rates, hosting provider, customization requirements, content migration complexity, and in-house capabilities. These figures represent typical ranges observed across multiple implementations but should not be considered guaranteed pricing. Always obtain detailed, written quotes from 2-3 implementation partners before making budget decisions.
