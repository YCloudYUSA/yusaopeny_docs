## Paragraphs and Layout Builder

This call features a comparison of pages created using Paragraphs and Layout Builder. Paragraphs is a Drupal module that allows users to create structured content by assembling predefined "paragraphs" of different types. Layout Builder, on the other hand, is a core Drupal module that provides a drag-and-drop interface for arranging blocks and other content elements on a page.

*   **Paragraphs Module:** The [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) module enables the creation of Paragraphs entities.

*   **Layout Builder:** Layout Builder allows arranging blocks and content elements on a page using a drag-and-drop interface.
