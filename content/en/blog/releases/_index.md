This section provides information on releases, including how to find release notes, compatibility information, and upgrade instructions.

## Finding Releases

Releases for Drupal core and contributed projects are typically found on their respective project pages on Drupal.org. Look for links labeled "Downloads" or "Releases".

## Release Notes

Release notes provide detailed information about a specific release, including:

*   New features
*   Bug fixes
*   Security updates
*   Upgrade instructions
*   Known issues
*   API changes

Always review the release notes before upgrading to a new version.

## Compatibility

Before upgrading, ensure that the new release is compatible with your current Drupal version, PHP version, and other dependencies. Compatibility information is usually included in the release notes.

## Upgrade Instructions

Follow the upgrade instructions provided in the release notes carefully. Back up your database and files before starting the upgrade process. Test the upgraded site thoroughly before making it live.

## Security Releases

Security releases address critical security vulnerabilities. It is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest security release as soon as possible. Security releases are often designated with a version number that includes ".x" (e.g., 9.1.x).

## Contributed Modules and Themes

Remember to check for updates and releases for your contributed modules and themes regularly. Keeping these up-to-date is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of your Drupal site.
