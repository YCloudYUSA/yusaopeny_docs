Requirements This module requires the following modules:
openy_map (For pulling the list of location-related content types.) This module also requires one of the following to store data:
A Solr server (preferably a server or index per-environment). A subscription with access to the Daxko API. Recommended modules Activity Finder is most often used with a syncer to pull data from an external source.</description></item><item><title>Activity Finder</title><link>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/activity-finder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/activity-finder/</guid><description>Activity Finder combines data from the Activity, Class, and Session content types into an interactive tool that can be used with Paragraphs or Layout Builder pages.
Out-of-the-box, YMCA Website Servicesâ€™s Activity Finder integrates with Daxko, ActiveNet, and Personify. Configuring these integrations is mostly user-friendly, but often is supported by a partner development team. Any other CRM will require custom developer work.
See the Program Event Framework developer docs for a full list of integrations.</description></item><item><title>Group Schedules</title><link>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/group-schedules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/group-schedules/</guid><description>Sometimes called &amp;ldquo;Group Exercise&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Group Schedules&amp;rdquo;, the Repeat Schedules block provides a similar view to Activity Finder, but focuses on recurring, often drop-in classes. You can see an example of this on our sandbox site.
Developers can find more information in ynorth-project/openy_repeat and Program Event Framework.

Configuring the Calculator The Membership Calculator uses Membership content items. Those will need to be created in order for the Membership Calculator to function.
First, create a Membership node for each membership type your Branch or Association offers.</description></item><item><title>Membership Framework</title><link>/docs/user-documentation/membership/framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/user-documentation/membership/framework/</guid><description>The Membership Framework is distributed in the openy_memberships repository and must be added and installed on top of the base distribution. We recommend working with your development partner if you wish to go this route.
Check out the Membership Framework sandboxes for a demonstration.
Membership Landing Pages To get started with the Membership Framework you will first need to create a number of landing pages.
The examples below use Paragraphs, but similar pages can be created using Layout Builder blocks and the Membership Framework custom block.</description></item><item><title>PEF Schedules</title><link>/docs/development/program-event-framework/pef-schedules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/development/program-event-framework/pef-schedules/</guid><description>YCloudYUSA/y_pef_schedule
