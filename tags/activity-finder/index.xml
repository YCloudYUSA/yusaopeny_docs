How it Works This paragraph type requires an integration into a CRM. See Program Activity Framework for a list of existing integrations. Any other CRM will require custom developer work.
How you use these paragraphs will depend on how your Association has structured its program data on the CRM and on how you decide to get people to program results.</description></item><item><title>Activity Finder</title><link>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/activity-finder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/user-documentation/schedules/activity-finder/</guid><description>Activity Finder combines data from the Activity, Class, and Session content types into an interactive tool that can be used with Paragraphs or Layout Builder pages.
Out-of-the-box, YMCA Website Servicesâ€™s Activity Finder integrates with Daxko, ActiveNet, and Personify. Configuring these integrations is mostly user-friendly, but often is supported by a partner development team. Any other CRM will require custom developer work.
See the Program Event Framework developer docs for a full list of integrations.</description></item><item><title>Activity, Class, and Session</title><link>/docs/user-documentation/content-types/activity-class-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/user-documentation/content-types/activity-class-session/</guid><description>Content editors rarely, if ever, enter information directly into these content types on a day-to-day basis.
