## Total Implementation Effort

### If All 7 Options Implemented:
- **Phase 1 (High Priority):** 5-8 hours
- **Phase 2 (High Value):** 5-7 hours
- **Phase 3 (Developer):** 3-4 hours
- **Phase 4 (Polish):** 4-6 hours
- **Total:** ~17-25 hours

## Questions for Decision

1. **Which options should we prioritize?** (Recommend: Phase 1 + Phase 2)
2. **Should cards be interactive?** (Hover effects, expand/collapse)
3. **Icon source?** (Font Awesome, custom SVG, or emoji)
4. **Badge system?** (Categories, difficulty, status)
5. **Progressive disclosure?** (Show top 3 links, expand for more)
6. **Search integration?** (Filter cards by keyword)

---

## Next Steps

Once priorities are confirmed:
1. Create reusable card component CSS
2. Implement Option 1 (Layout Builder) as proof of concept
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Roll out to remaining pages
5. Document card component for future use
